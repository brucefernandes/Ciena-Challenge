CIENA CODING CHALLENGE

- To satisfy requirement, all jupyter notebook files were exported as python files and stored in ./python_files
- To run python files:
    - ensure packages are installed (yfinance, pandas, numpy)
    - ensure Python 3.8.9 is installed
    - for example "pip3 install yfinance"
    - cd into ./python_files
    - run 'python3 download_s\&p500.py' first
    - run 'python3 analysis_s\&p500.py'

- To run jupyter notebooks, simply download the files and import them into google collab. You can run the files from there.
